AirMobileFbLogin
================

Sample app that shows how to implement facebook login on mobile.

I had a lot of trouble getting the mobile facebook login to work. So I hope this sample saves some time and headaches.

This sample was built and tested with Flex SDK 4.6.0 and Air 3.5.6

It requires the facebook-actionscript-api:

I tested this with version 1.8.1
